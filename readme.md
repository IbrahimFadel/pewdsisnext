# it's down

I had to take it down because EC2 costs wayyy too much. If i find the time i'll put it on my pi, but i'm too lazy


# pewdsisnext
Do you remember when Jake Paul uttered the words: "Pewdiepie is next"? Well Pewds is at over 100M while Jake Paul remains at 20M. He will rue the day

This bot gets pewdiepie's live sub count as well as Jake Pauls, and tweets a randomized message to @jakepaul every day reminding him of his failures. It let's him know the current sub gap between him and pewdiepie.

Follow the bot, @NextPewdiepie

## Unfortunately

In september of 2019, youtube changed their api to round any subscriber count above 1000. Therefore the subgap will be displayed as something like the following: 82,000,000. I was hoping for it to show each subscriber, but oh well
